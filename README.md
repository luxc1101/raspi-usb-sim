# PRIAPOS

<img src="https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/F60/5H8G/KNHGQNWP/F605H8GKNHGQNWP.png?auto=webp&frame=1&width=810&fit=bounds&md=38489d1a10177d77d78f77287ad3bd0a" width="100" >

The idea aims to reduice the amount of work for USB sticks plug in & out during the testing. Raspberry Pi Zero can emulate USB devices (MSC, HID, Eth Adapter, etc). The tool can also automate tests via SSH communication. The PID/VID of the emulated USB devices can be easily adjusted as well.

### Connections

Before starting, it is important to know that the Raspberry Pi and the test PC need to be on the same wireless network. It is usually the latter that has troubles connecting to the wireless networks as most test rack PCs at JND do not have this capacity.

Therefore, you must first secure a USB WLAN-Stick, plug it in to your test PC and connect to the desired 2.4 GHz WiFi network wirelessly.

#### Preparing the Rpi: Editing the WiFi Configuration File
>
> **NOTE**:  
>Once you have already configured the WiFi SSID and PSK in step [Operation System Installation](#operation-system-installation) and the WiFi is not changed (SSID, PSK) and still available, you can skip this step.

Only if WiFi network was changed, `ssh` (without file typ) and `wpa_supplicant.conf` (with new WiFi ssid and password) should write into bootfs partition of SD card.

<details>
  <summary>wpa_supplicant.conf</summary>

  ```
  # Datei wpa_supplicant.conf in der Boot-Partition (Raspbian Stretch)
  country=DE
  update_config=1
  ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
  network={
  key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
  ssid="<SSID>>"
  psk="<password>"
  }
  ```
</details>

#### Preparing the Rpi: Mounting and Connections

Once the microSD card has been updated, remove it from the microSD card reader and mount it on the Rpi.

Then plugin USB Micro-B cable (Power) and USB Micro-B cable (OTG). Now, the tester is instructed to make the following connections.

<img src="image/RaspiZeroWAssembly.png" width="250">

#### Preparing the SSH Connection: IP, Port, SSID and Password
>
> **NOTE**:  
>it could take few mins at FIRST time until Rpi connected to the WiFi.

WiFi sources may be different, such as routers, hotspots, etc. Raspberry IP address could be check in different ways:

##### Router
>
> **Hint**:  
> if WiFi network was changed, ssh (without file typ) and wpa_supplicant.conf (with new WiFi ssid and password) should be firstly written into bootfs partition of micoSD card.
<details>

- solution 1 (recommend)
  - connect local machine to WiFi via USB WiFi adapter, e.g. WiFi SSID: `AMB-StreamWLAN`, PW: *********
  - typing router ip address http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/ on browser, check IP-Address of the conencted device with name e.g. `raspberrypi`

      <img src="image/RouterIPList.png" width="500">

- solution 2
  - Using Putty to connect to Rpi to allow access to the Rpi via ssh and save login info as session
    - Hostname: e.g. `raspberrypi.local`→[enter]
    - Login as: `pi`
    - PW: `raspberry`

        ```bash
        hostname -I # 192.168.188.xx
        ```

- solution 3
  - open a terminal

      ```powershell
      ping <Hostname> # ping raspberrypi.local
      ```

      expected output

      ```
      Ping wird ausgeführt für raspberrypi.local [192.168.188.38] mit 32 Bytes Daten:
      Antwort von 192.168.188.38: Bytes=32 Zeit=22ms TTL=64
      ...
      ```
</details>

##### Mobile Hotspot
>
> **Hint**:  
> if WiFi network was changed, ssh (without file typ) and wpa_supplicant.conf (with new WiFi ssid and password) should firstly be written into bootfs partition of micoSD card.
<details>

- activate Hotspot with Band **2.4 GHz** through mobile hotspot device (e.g. Samsung Galaxy S21)
- make sure that PC and Rpi device is connected to Android Phone Hotspot
  
    <img src="image/Mobile_hotspot.jpg" width="100">
- check rapberry pi device IP address from Android Phone

    <img src="image/IP_in_Phone.jpg" width="100">

once WiFi connection in Rpi is establish, connect PC to the same WiFi, and go ping Rpi device is to find out if a device is reachable at a particular IP address:

open a terminal (PC or VM)

```powershell
ping <raspi ip address> 
```

expected output

```Confluence
Ping wird ausgeführt für 192.168.209.31 mit 32 Bytes Daten:
Antwort von 192.168.209.31: Bytes=32 Zeit=241ms TTL=64
Antwort von 192.168.209.31: Bytes=32 Zeit=12ms TTL=64
...
```
</details>

### SSHClient Creation

With the GUI `USBSimulator.exe` launched, click on the `SSH Connect` button and new menu (Raspi SSH Connection) will pop up asking you for details such as IP Address, Port Number, Username, and SSID, etc., as shown below:

<img src="image/SSHConnectionDialog.png" width="250">

Now input the IP address in the SSH connect sub menu, select the SSID and  input its corresponding password and hit Connect.

<img src="image/SSHClient.png" width="250">

Now a SSHClient is via USB Tool created, you can try to type and sent command through command line editor, e.g. pwd, it should work.

<img src="image/SSHPwd.png" width="250">

### Configuration

#### Preparing package installation and configuration for Rpi

click button `Install USB Gadget`, installation dialog will pop up, select folder `./usbtool_install` from browser

<img src="image/USBSwUpload.png" width="250">

click button `install`, start the installation and wait until the progress is complete

<img src="image/USBSwInstall.png" width="250">

If no errors occur during the installation process, the Rpi device will automatically reboot.
